# Building an Effective Vulnerability Management Program

*Abstract:*

Every company’s approach to building a vulnerability management program can be quite unique with different processes, procedures, and tool sets under their belts. When considering the life cycle of vulnerability management (Discovery, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediation, Verify), there are key components which should be a main focus which we will review here. Inventory management, patch management, and risk assessment are a few of these key areas which will aide in building an effective program and ensure that full scope and coverage is achieved. In this presentation, we will discuss this lifecycle and its key components and how they interrelate. Pulling from experiences working with my company’s IT organization and business units and building our program from the ground up we will dive into prioritizations, approaches, challenges, and tips for building your program effectively. There is not a “one size fits” all solution, but there is a general set of items for consideration that can be applied across different industries that can be translated to a wider audience than that of IT organizations. Effectively communicating the output of this work is a key to success, and that is that will be sum total of the work put into your program.
